### [In Progress: Initial Design of an Ultra Premium, Long Range Business Jet](AERO520.md)

Key requirements: 
  - Minimum cruise speed of Mach 0.85
  - 8,000 nautical mile range
  - Complies with FAA 14 CFR Part 25
  - Takeoff & landing on a 6,000 ft runway
  - Capable of VFR and IFR flight
  - Seating for 8 passengers (60 in pitch, 22 in width)
  - Pressurization capability for 6,000 ft cabin altitude at maximum service ceiling
  - Capable of flight in known icing conditions

### [In Progress: FAR 23 Avionics Certification Report](AERO410.md)

Certification scope:
  - Electrical load analysis across operating cases (normal, abnormal, emergency)
  - Essential/non-essential bus and avionics power distribution architecture
  - Wire gauge selection using current demand, harness length, and allowable voltage drop
  - Circuit protection sizing (breakers/fuses) aligned with load type and wiring limits
  - Compliance-style documentation: load tables, wiring schedules, and justification notes

### [Fly-By-Wire Aircraft Simulation with Yaw and Roll Stabilization](fbw_game.md)
Implemented a Fly-By-Wire (FBW) control system to stabilize an unstable B-2–style aircraft for a precision bombing mission.
