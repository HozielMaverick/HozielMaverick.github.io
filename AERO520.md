This project focuses on the conceptual design of an ultra-long-range premium business jet developed in response to a defined Request for Proposal (RFP). The design process integrates multiple engineering tools, including Advanced Aircraft Analysis (AAA), CAD software, and MATLAB’s Aircraft Intuitive Design (AID), to evaluate performance, sizing, and feasibility throughout early development stages.

The RFP outlining the design objectives and constraints is provided below.

### Report 1 - Initial Weight Sizing

The first phase of the project concentrated on preliminary weight sizing. Key aircraft weight parameters were estimated and iteratively refined to ensure alignment with performance requirements while maintaining compliance with the RFP specifications. This initial sizing process established the baseline configuration and provided the foundation for subsequent aerodynamic, performance, and systems analyses.
