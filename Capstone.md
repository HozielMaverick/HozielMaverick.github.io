Status as of January 30, 2026

The project has been conducted through a structured experimental workflow to characterize Mach–Zehnder modulation, link performance, and signal integrity under IM/DD transmission conditions.

Phase 1 — Modulator Characterization

The Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM) was characterized to establish key device parameters including insertion loss (IL) and half-wave voltage (Vπ). These measurements provided a baseline understanding of modulation efficiency and biasing requirements for high-speed operation.

Phase 2 — BER and SNR Analysis

A Bit Pattern Generator (BPG) was connected to a Digital Communications Analyzer (DCA) to evaluate Bit Error Rate (BER) across multiple operating frequencies. The resulting BER measurements were used to estimate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and assess performance limitations at increasing data rates.

Phase 3 — Eye Diagram and Signal Integrity Evaluation

The BPG was directly interfaced with the DCA to generate eye diagrams and evaluate baseline signal integrity. These measurements allowed for observation of timing jitter, noise, and amplitude variations independent of optical modulation effects.

Phase 4 — Optical Link Testing with MZM

The MZM was integrated into the transmission setup with a laser source, bias voltage control, BPG input, and DCA receiver. Eye diagrams were captured after transmission over 2 km and 5 km fiber spans to evaluate jitter accumulation and signal degradation with distance.

Next Phase — TFLN PIC Evaluation

Upcoming work will focus on testing TFLN-based modulator chips integrated on photonic integrated circuits operating in the O-band. Special emphasis will be placed on waveguide crossings to quantify insertion loss, crosstalk, and reflection effects at data rates exceeding 20 Gbps.
